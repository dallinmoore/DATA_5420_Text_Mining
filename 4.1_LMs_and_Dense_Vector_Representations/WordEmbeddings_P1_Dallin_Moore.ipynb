        "In this notebook we will cover several models used for feature engineering word embeddings for text, so that we can better represent word meaning in our texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example we will use the *King James Bible* from the gutenberg corpus as a large sample that we can use to train a word-embedding model. Training word-embedding models is pretty computationally expesnive, and time-consuming. So, I'm going to show you how to access a GPU instance from google colab and you will run this notebook outside of class :)\n",
        "\n",
        "While I want you to understand how word-embedding models can be trained, in the next template, we'll also play around with some pretrained models as well, which oftentimes can work quite well out of the box and can save time and effort. We'll apply those pretrained models to our toy corpus from P1 and then extend it to our document clustering.\n",

Once you do that, you'll need to rerun the above cells (it will start a new session) and then go ahead and kick off training.
