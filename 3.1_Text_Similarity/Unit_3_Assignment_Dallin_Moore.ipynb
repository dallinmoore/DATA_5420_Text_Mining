Initially, the lyrics of each song will undergo preprocessing, including tokenization and noise removal. Subsequently, the TextRank algorithm will rank the importance of sentences within the lyrics based on their semantic similarity, effectively identifying key phrases and themes. The top-ranked sentences will then be selected to form a summary for each song, capturing its essence and main ideas. Finally, these individual song summaries will be aggregated to create a comprehensive summary for the entire playlist, providing users with a quick overview of the playlist's content and enabling them to make informed decisions about their listening preferences. This approach ensures that users receive relevant and informative summaries tailored to their input text, enhancing their overall engagement and satisfaction with the playlist recommendation system."
