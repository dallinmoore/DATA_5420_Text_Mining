rome at festival time. characters octobera tall girl. witcha tall girl or boy. trumpetera small boy. applesfour girls. pearsfour girls. bananasfour girls. grapesfour girls. childa small boy. pomonaa young lady. suitorsany number of boys. vertumnusa young man. costume suggestions while no special costumes are necessary they will add to the program. the fruits especially should be made to represent what they speak of and the horn of plenty may be made of pasteboard decorated with colored fruits and flowers or a large waste basket filled with fruits would do for this purpose. october will be pretty crowned with autumn leaves. there will be no difficulty in getting a long black cape for the witch and a pointed black hat. she carries a cane and raps on the floor when ready to recite. consult any ancient history for costumes for pomona and her suitors. scene i in the woods. october i am october my fruits are mellow my autumn leaves are red and yellow i am october my voice you hear
